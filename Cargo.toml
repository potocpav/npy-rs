# Reexports the derive macros so that you can use them qualified under `npy::`:
#
#     #[derive(npy::Serialize, npy::Deserialize, npy::AutoSerialize)]
#     struct Struct { ... }
#
# This is a nicer alternative to `#[macro_use] extern crate npy_derive`, which
# directly imports things like `#[derive(Serialize)]` that may conflict with
# other crates (e.g. `serde`).
